## OpenFaaS Workshop

Welcome to the OpenFaaS workshop! In this workshop, we will guide you through setting up a development environment for working with serverless functions using OpenFaaS. You will learn how to create, deploy, and manage functions, using a local setup on your own machine.

### Toolchain Overview

The workshop toolchain includes:

- **Vagrant:** A tool for building and managing virtual machine environments.
- **Virtualization Backend:** Either QEMU (recommended for macOS) or VirtualBox for Windows users.
- **OpenFaaS:** A framework for building serverless functions that run on Docker.

We provide step-by-step setup instructions for both Silicon-based macOS and Windows environments.

### Setup Instructions

Please follow the appropriate guide for your operating system:

1.  [**Setup for Silicon Mac**](src/branch/master/Install%20Vagrant%20on%20Windows.md)
    - Instructions for setting up Vagrant on an Apple Silicon (M1, M2) Mac.
2.  [**Setup for Windows**](src/branch/master/Install%20Vagrant%20on%20Windows.md)
    - Instructions for setting up Vagrant on a Windows system.

Each guide will walk you through installing the necessary dependencies, setting up the virtualization backend, and preparing the environment for the workshop.
